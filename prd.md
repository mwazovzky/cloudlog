# CloudLog - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

CloudLog is a structured logging library designed to provide efficient, flexible logging capabilities for Go applications, with native integration support for popular centralized logging systems like Grafana Loki.

## Goals

1. Provide a simple, consistent API for structured logging
2. Support sending logs to Grafana Loki with minimal configuration
3. Allow flexible log formatting options
4. Enable context propagation in logs
5. Offer strong testing utilities for applications using the library
6. Maintain minimal external dependencies

## Non-Goals

1. Supporting every possible logging backend (focus on Loki first)
2. Implementing complex log routing or filtering
3. Replacing enterprise-grade logging systems

## User Personas

### Application Developer

- Needs to add structured logging to their application
- Wants a simple API with minimal setup
- Prefers Go-idiomatic interfaces

### DevOps Engineer

- Needs to centralize logs in Grafana Loki
- Wants to configure logging parameters
- Needs to match log format with existing systems

### QA Engineer

- Needs to verify that logs contain expected information
- Wants to test logging behavior in automated tests

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Structured Logging**

   - Support key-value pair logging
   - Support common log levels (info, error, debug, warn)
   - Include timestamps in logs

2. **Loki Integration**

   - Send logs to Grafana Loki using the proper streams format
   - Support authentication
   - Handle connection failures gracefully
   - Format payload according to Loki's API requirements
   - Include appropriate timestamps and labels

3. **Formatting**

   - Support JSON formatting
   - Support human-readable formatting
   - Allow customization of field names and formats

4. **Context**

   - Allow adding context to logger instances
   - Propagate context in all subsequent logs
   - Support job/source identification

5. **Testing**
   - Provide utilities for capturing and validating logs
   - Support searching logs by level, message, and fields

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**

   - Minimal CPU and memory overhead
   - Efficient log serialization
   - Non-blocking logging operations

2. **Reliability**

   - Graceful error handling
   - No panics in production code
   - Proper resource cleanup

3. **Usability**

   - Clear, consistent API
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Useful examples

4. **Extensibility**
   - Allow custom formatters
   - Support for additional log senders
   - Pluggable architecture

## Success Metrics

1. Clean API with minimal boilerplate for common operations
2. Successful integration with Grafana Loki using the correct payload format
3. Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
4. Complete documentation with examples
5. No runtime panics or resource leaks
